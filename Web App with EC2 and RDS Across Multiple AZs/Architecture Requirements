Draw an architecture that:
- Uses two EC2 instances in different Availability Zones
- Connects both EC2 instances to a single RDS database set up with Multi-AZ deployment
- Uses a Load Balancer to route user traffic to the EC2 instances
- Is deployed in one AWS Region
Explain how this architecture improves reliability and minimizes downtime if one
Availability Zone fails.
