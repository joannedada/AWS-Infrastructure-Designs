They are going to host around 8000 Servers
These 8k servers are grouped into two subnets each with 4k servers

First Subnet is for web servers, around 4k
Second Subnet is for database servers, around 4k
In the future, they might add more number of subnets i.e application servers subnets, load balancer subnet.
